The currencies in "cryptolist" are formatted to be compatible with the coinmarketcap API. 

You may however, have to use different terminology in your scraper. 



For example:

"enigma-project" is the call name on coinmarketcap api.

However, on reddit it would be reffered to as only "enigma" 



Similarly, "request-network" would just be "request network" on reddit.

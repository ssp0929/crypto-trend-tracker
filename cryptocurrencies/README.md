# Cryptolist.txt

The currencies in "cryptolist" are formatted to be compatible with the coinmarketcap API.
You may however, have to use different terminology in your scraper.

# Example

"enigma-project" is the call name on coinmarketcap api.
However, on reddit it would be referred to as only "enigma"
Similarly, "request-network" would just be "request network" on reddit.

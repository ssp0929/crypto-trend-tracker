Directly follow latest information and sentiment and act accordingly. (Follow the reddit page, Twitter, website, sign up for alerts)\n\n4. Take time to learn chart analysis, even if it is just the fundamentals. It will increase your ability to predict the market and hone your decision making.\n\nThis strategy mitigates risk by diversifying and locking in a strong foundation for trusted coins and increasing your holdings by transferring value between them. \n\nDO YOUR RESEARCH. \n\nIf you truly believe in Blockchain then you are in it for the long game.

Using the 10 to 1 ratio of losers and winners, probably only two of the 20 altcoins would be in the winners list of yours. Pick BTC as one, and any of the random ones from the rest. Let's pick the second top performer, XRP.\n\n- BTC: $50 x 14 = $700\n- XRP: $50 x 335 = $16750\n\nTotal comes out at $16750 + $700 = roughtly $17,500 (and you would probably lose some of the remaining $900 of your original $1000).\n\nSo a typical gain (assuming a lot of things like rational diversification, HODLing, no-FOMO, etc) would be 15x to 20x over $1000. Any other kind of strategy would be not too different from gambling.\n\n15x to 20x in one year is pretty good. But not as good as the gains in XRP, NEO, ETH etc.\n\n**edit**: I noticed OP may have meant $1000 per coin not $1000 total. My point still holds. A $10k would turn into $150k to $200k in a near best case scenario.\n\n**edit 2**: Would this be repeated in 2018? who knows. Total coin market cap is hovering around $600b for the past many weeks. On Jan 1, 2017 it was $18b, so a 33x increase in one year. For 2018 to repeat 2017 performance, cap will have go from $6b to $20T (twenty trillion USD) which is very unrealistic IMO (that's a quarter of the world economy!). But if 2017 was a unique year that followed the center of the \"S curve\" then we might see a slowdown, i.e., a cap increase from $600b to maybe a $1T or so. In which case the gains would be more like 1.5x to 2x, not 15x to 20x! (or in the worst case, the $600b is a bubble and we might see a correction down to $300b or something, in which case the rational actor actually loses money)."

At least it's not just scams going up so everyone wins somehow. Seeing bytecoin do almost just as well worries me how little anyone cares about security or tech-literacy anymore.

    "content": "To understand what is Navcoin, and it will target the Top 20 Crytocurrencies market cap in 2018 (have a look, compare and make your choice) :\n\n\nTo start, NAV isn't just a \"privacy\" focused coin. In Q1 2018, it will become a \"privacy\" focused platform/ecosystem. That makes NAV markedly different than Verge and Monero, aka huge growth potential over the next few months :). NAV is also POS whereas Monero is POW. I believe POS is the future of blockchain. No surprise that Ethereum is looking to migrate to POS as well in 2018. There are many more attributes that make NAV more versatile than Monero. That said, I like Monero as well. Here's a few highlights that explain NAV more for you:\n\nNavChain (the teams working title for the anonymous dapps platform)\n\nAs I mentioned above will be a privacy focused platform/ecosystem (I hate linking us to another project, but think anonymity of ethereum/neo). Once NavChain (Adapps) is built (the whitepaper is set to release in early Q1), the first planned anonymous application will be NavTech2.0.\n\nBonus: The devs are developing a working prototype of NavChain as we speak (including a working protoype of NavTech2.0). This will lead to faster development of the actual product.\n\nRead more from the AMA: https://navtechservers.com/ama30102017/\n\nNavTech2.0\n\nBecause NAV is a POS coin, NavTech2.0 will make every individual staking wallet have the option to act as a private server, which will create a fully decentralized mesh network of private payment servers. This is truly revolutionary in that it will create a trustless network. It solves the current concerns regarding trusting a small set of servers for private payments.\n\nFor more information https://navcoin.org/news/a-guide-to-navtech/\n\nCommunity Fund\n\nNav recently passed a community fund which will reduce the staking rewards from 5% to 4%. The purpose is to use the 1% staking rewards to finish roadmap projects; hire more devs/marketers; market product launches; and finish community projects. \"This equates to about $1M USD per year (at the current price) to spend on community projects, the core teams development roadmap and marketing initiatives \u2013 which will be a huge boost to the project.\"\n\nRead more here: https://navcoin.org/news/community-fund-success/\n\nPolymorph:\n\nPolymorph is a web service designed to allow users to anonymise any of the currencies which are exchangeable on Changelly. How it works is best summarised by this slide from our 2016 Nav Coin Conference:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UpNL6uA.jpg\n\nThe user chooses their input currency & amount, output currency & destination address. Polymorph will exchange whatever currency is input to NAV with Changelly, send it through our dual blockchain private payment platform NavTech, then exchange it back to the specified output currency and send it to its destination.\n\nYou can specify the same input and output currencies, or you could actually use it as an exchange service also, inputting BTC and outputting ETH for example.\n\nCopied from our lead dev here: https://www.reddit.com/r/NavCoin/comments/6ii8xm/what_is_polymorph_project/dj6wn02/\n\nNavPay\n\nCheck out the most recent NavPay launch: https://twitter.com/NAVCoin/status/943738103839289344.

It's coming to iOS soon.\n\nMore info here: https://navcoin.org/navpay/\n\nEDIT\n\nNavPi and coming in 2018 NavPi 2.0 25% complete\n\nThe NavPi is the Nav Coin Raspberry Pi 3 Stakebox.

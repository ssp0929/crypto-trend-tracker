In addition to executing payment-style transactions like Bitcoin, arbitrary code (programs) can be run through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node in the Ethereum network executes operations within the EVM to ensure redundantly correct execution and relies on consensus to agree on the answer.\n\nEthereum runs of a token called Ether (ETH). The protocol uses a pricing mechanism called Gas, and this gas limit is paid in Ether. This gas limit is the amount of compute power you're asking the network to run in order to execute your smart contract or transaction. The Ethereum protocol actually defines an amount of gas required to process every single instruction available within Solidity, Ethereum's programming language. \n\n\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nEthereum's ability to run decentralized smart contracts opens the possibility for decentralized applications/organizations. What Ethereum proposes in effect is a global computer that could not only handle store of value transactions but also eventually emulate many of the functions of companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Amazon, and Kickstarter, but without the inefficient bureaucracies and the other intermediaries who take a slice of the pie.\n\nCurrently Ethereum's platform underlies much of the new ICOs being created. In the future its expected that dApps would run on the blockchain and allow companies to offload much of their processing needs onto the blockchain. In essence its almost like running your organization on a cloud, except its one that its trustless and secured b the blockchain structure.\n\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nThere are currently 35 developers participating in the open source development process, however the direction is controlled by the Ethereum Foundation:\n\nhttp://www.ethereum.org/foundation\n\nEthereum's founder Vitalik Buterin is probably as close as we'll ever get to having a figurehead for the cryptocurrency movement, and his opinion on what's going on in the space is closely followed. He attended the University of Waterloo but dropped out in 2014, when he received the Thiel Fellowship in the amount of $100,000, and went to work on Ethereum full-time.\n\n\n**What current product/partnership exists?**\n\nEthereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by enterprise software companies. Interested parties include:\n\n* Microsoft\n* IBM\n* JPMorgan Chase\n* Deloitte\n* Innovate UK (cross-border payments prototype)\n\nCurrently Barclays, UBS, Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum blockchain to automate markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements.\n\nIn March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members. By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members\u2014including CME Group, Toyota Research Institute, Samsung SDS, Microsoft, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Cooley LLP, Merck KGaA, DTCC, Deloitte, Accenture, Banco Santander, BNY Mellon, ING, and National Bank of Canada.\n\nYou can see more at:\n\nhttp://entethalliance.org/members/\n\n**What is the roadmap going forward?**\n\nThe Ethereum framework is continually evolving, with a major Constantinople software update expected this year to revolve around moving from POW to Proof of Stake, with the [Casper POS protocol](http://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost). In Casper style proof of stake, anyone can participate in block production by posting a bond. After posting a bond you have an opportunity to bet on which block will be included next to the main chain. The incentives are such that you make money by betting with the eventual consensus and lose money by betting against the consensus. Any crypto-graphically provable misbehavior results in the forfeit of the bond.\n\n**What are the weaknesses/problems related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Ethereum isn't as developer friendly as some of its competitors in many ways. For example NEO has a compiler that supports multiple mainstream programming languages, while Ethereum has for a long time relied on Solidity. Good news is that there are projects in the works to bring full support for more common languages like Java and C++\n\n* Ethereum has a larger \"attack surface\" in that it allows executable code on a distributed system. What do we do when some criminal person (or group of people) exploits a bug in the smart contract?\n\n* Difficult long-term scaling considerations. While cryptokitties brought the Ethereum network to its knees because of the 25 tps limit, the POS migration will hopefully allow an exponential increase in throughput.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

In my own calculations I expect this to be 80% or more of Q. \nParts of it may go to staking but certainly not everything.  \n\n2) ETH bound in medium to long term contracts\n\nThe quantity of this is hard to assess and depends on future use cases. \nIf, however, Ethereum will play a major role in the coming M2M economy, the wallets of all these machines alone will bind considerable amounts of ETHs. Other use cases such as e.g. atomic swaps with other blockchains, credits, escrows etc. will also increase the scarcity of floating ETHs. \n\nAll in all, I would expect no more than 10% of Q (probably even less) being available for circulation. \n\nThis would bring the current value to roughly 5x your estimation, i.e. $9,000.\n\n "

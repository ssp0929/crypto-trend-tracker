Researching blockchain technology has really got me curious about digging deeper into the mechanics of it. One day I might even be able to actually make something using this cool new concept, even if it's just a personal project.\n\nI wanted to know what kind of language I should start with, being a total beginner. So far I know that Bitcoin uses C++, which is I believe based on C, but I don't know if I need to learn C first. I also know Ethereum uses GoLang, which I've read is super easy to learn compared to C++ or other languages. Any thoughts?"

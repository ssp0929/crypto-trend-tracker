Also that third failover,  with no real explanation where in that sequence of events the corruption occurred, is suspect. \n\nIn their statement Binance explains that 'we noticed data corruption, growing slowly'.    In my experience that is not indicative of corruption of data due to hardware failure.  Corrupt data due to a scrambled hard disk will almost always quickly halt a system due to basic error handling in the code.    Slowly growing 'corruption' sounds more like a bug.   \n\n\nRed Flag #3\n\n\nBinance goes down for a 'server upgrade'.  This is the one that got me suspicious. Whenever the Binance people first conceived of their crypto currency exchange,  they had to know it would need to be 24/7.  I can't believe that their intention wasn't that they would build a highly available system, i.e. it would never go down for a server upgrade. Yet now, less than a week after their 'crash',  they go offline for a server upgrade.\n\n\nRed Flag #4\n\n\nToday there are comments in the Binance subreddit about Nano deposits taking forever,  some speculate they are taking special processing due to the BitGrail theft.  Earlier I read a comment in the Daily sticky in u/cryptocurrency that someone found an exploit (didn't say where).  Someone replied \"dude , PM me!\",  kind of sad.  After that comment was another about Binance showing double booking of Nano,  and that Binance and Nano were 'in touch'.   I can no longer find those comments,  I can't even see [Deleted] or [Removed] in the Daily stickies,  I'm kind of concerned about that as well!\n\nSo what the hell is going on?  Is there a problem with Nano?  Is the core protocol broken? Is this double dipping Nano's fault? \n\nI highly doubt it.  I would speculate though that there is something about Nano that's maybe a little different that other cryptos that the exchange devs are not understanding.  Perhaps poor documentation,  poorly understood, something very subtle.   The exploit that was created at BitGrail could also also have existed at Binance,  the 'Crash' followed by hastily announced 'server upgrades' could be a ruse. \n\nTin Foil Hat now off\n\nGood Luck!\n\nedit: removed paragraph per comment reply"}, {"score": 9, "matches": ["ethereum", "neo", "icon"], "content": "I don't think ICX is a good investment.\n\nNEO was good because China would block a lot of Ethereum networking in their country.

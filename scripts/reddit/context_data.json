Customizable, universally public blockchain infrastructure to aid in enterprise level deployment of applications. Open-source. Proof-of-credit and smart contracts.\n\nCompetitive advantage: \n\n* Creation of a modular blockchain that allows ease of development in the enterprise setting, creating value for industries and companies. \n\nDevelopment/founder/company vesting: \n\n* Only 1% of the tokens are unlocked per month for the next 20 months. They are committed to building a product and staked their coins on it.\n\nCommunity development: \n\n* 1% of coins each month are distributed to the community to support building of an ecosystem on the Nuls blockchain.\n\nPrevious work in Crypto & Blockchain:\n\n* \u201cInchain\u201d \u2013 a previous project built by the same core development team that won the award for Most Innovative and Creative Project at China\u2019s Blockchain Technological Innovation Contest (source: http://blog.inchain.org/archives/293). Inchain also did not fund their ICO and returned all investor dollars back to their Chinese investors. \n\n* This team is legit, they\u2019ve been around the block, and they are going to build the next layer for enterprise blockchains in a way no one has done before (modular, proof of credit, AND smart contracts). Inchain product will be apart of Nuls blockchain.\n\nPartnerships: \n\n* Elephant Alliance (a huge Chinese conglomerate of businesses); Beijing Science and Technology Co., Ltd; and more than a dozen others in strategic partnership\n\nFinal Analysis:\n\n* Hugely skilled team, no USA marketing presence, flying under the radar with huge upside (sub $200M coin), a lot of trading volume, and partnerships in place with huge Chinese orgs. This is a company that will be valued as high as their current competitors (7x \u2013 15x) fairly soon I believe. Longer term will be dependent on the final product brought to market and full adoption.\n"

Yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pm5f6/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2018/dsiy0qy/\n\nThe prediction yesterday:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EhTmkna.png\n\nNow looks like:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/FnSZ3s7\n\nNice nice. And our log chart after the bounce I described is now looking like this:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Tg2KzSy\n\n3 out of the last 4 bounces off the bottom channel have us reaching the middle of the channel which puts us at $0.92. If we bounce to the top like last time, we're looking at $1.25 by the 15th. I'm hopeful but not delusional. I still think that XLM is a solid rocket in the next couple of days, just that I believe we're looking at a 50% growth, not 100%.\n\n(Trade at your own discretion not on my advice, do your own research and I could be wrong as fuckkkkk)"

It would break the virtuous circle that makes APPC valuable in the first place.\n\nIf users can earn APPC by trying apps and then trade that same APPC on external crypto exchanges, nobody will use it for in-app purchases--especially if the market value of the coin is constantly rising. That would also bring loads of people into the system who have no interest in actually trying apps, and just want to \"mine\" APPC by handing over their two minutes of attention to anyone who will pay for it. The ad campaigns will be grossly dysfunctional, and developers won't be willing to pay for them.\n\nAPPC can be a tool for disintermediating the app economy, or it can be the cheap and convenient entree to crypto trading that you've described here. I don't think it can be both, and I feel pretty confident that the dev team favors the former. \n\nAnybody can build an app that makes it cheap and easy to buy crypto. Coinbase has in fact already done that, and competitors will follow with better prices. Virtually any coin would be suitable for that use case. It doesn't make any sense for the APPC team to compromise the features of APPC that actually distinguish it and make it useful in order to compete in a space where they have no advantage."
